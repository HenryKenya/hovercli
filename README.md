# hovercli

The Hover CLI is a unified tool to manage your Hover configurations.

Configuration file should be in your home dir, default name `.hovercli.yaml`. It requires the following values:

```yaml
email: your@ema.il
password: y0urp455w0rd
organization_id: <yourOrganizationId>
```

NOTE: This is a first pass. We're in the process of updating our backend so you only have to supply your API key & secret.
